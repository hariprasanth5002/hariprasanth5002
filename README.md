## About Me

I design and build backend systems that integrate Artificial Intelligence into real-world applications.

My core focus areas include:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures
- Vector databases & embedding-based retrieval
- RESTful API development (Spring Boot / FastAPI)
- Computer Vision-based automation systems
- Speech-enabled AI assistants (STT + TTS integration)
- Modular and scalable system design

I prioritize clean architecture, maintainability, and production-oriented development practices.

## Architecture Mindset

When building systems, I follow:

- Clear modular folder structures
- Service-layer separation
- Embedding → Retrieval → Context → Response pipelines
- State-machine driven automation logic
- Dockerized deployments
- Structured commit semantics (feat/fix/refactor/docs)
